InstaBook is a social media platform just like Instagram and facebook.
I really like the design and feel of the instagram but it lacks the feature of Text post.
Technically we can post texts through stories but I like facebook's method of direct text post.

This app combines the features of both instagram as well as facebook.

Note: As of now there is no likes, comments and friends feature. Will try to add them in future.
